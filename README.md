# Trellio Frontend

### Installation
- Clone repo
- Make sure you have `Docker` and `Docker-compose` installed
- Run `docker-compose up`. This will run *Express* server on port *3001* and *MongoDB* on port *27017*. Next times run `docker-compose start` instead of `docker-compose up` because containers are already built and stored in the system
- Run `docker-compose stop` to stop running containers
- Profit!
